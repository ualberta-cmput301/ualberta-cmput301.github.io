<h3 id="project-problem-description">Project Problem Description</h3>
<p>Warning: This is subject to change!</p>
<h4 id="event-lottery-system-application"><strong>Event Lottery System Application</strong></h4>
<p>You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.</p>
<h4 id="description"><strong>Description:</strong></h4>
<p>We want a mobile application where people can sign up for events at community centers that are popular and fill up fast. We want to allow people with limitations such as work, disability, etc. to be able to sign up for these events fairly and not have to sit refreshing a webpage until they can get a chance at reserving a spot.</p>
<p>How? Lottery! If I am running swimming lessons for 20 kids, I will post my event or series of events and I will let everyone join the waiting list for a period of a week. After the week is up, I will ask the system to choose 20 kids to sign up. The system will then notify these kids (or their guardians), if they say no they don’t want swimming lessons, then the system will sample another child to sign up. I can monitor the progress and then get access to the final list of everyone who signs up. If perhaps someone cancels later I can cancel them in the app and a new applicant is drawn.</p>
<p>Lottery systems are great because you don’t have to first get a chance to go to an event, you just have to say you are interested and if you’re lucky you will be offered a chance. This gives people who need the time, the time to sign up properly without a time pressure. Accessibility!</p>
<h4 id="features"><strong>Features:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pooling System:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizers can draw from a waiting list of interested event attendees as selected participants.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want to sign my partner up to swim lessons, they need to learn how to swim if they are going to go canoeing with me. I go to the app, I find my local rec center, I see they have listed swimming lessons for beginners, and it is open to register for 2 more days. I click register. 2 days later when it is closed the system samples people, but not me. It notifies me that I wasn’t sampled in the first draw, but there might be a chance if someone declines. Nobody declines. Boo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am running an interpretive dance class where I teach the safety basics of dance (no eye gouging, that kind of stuff). I tell the app that I have classes every monday From 2025-01-01 to 2025-03-01, and that you need to register by 2024-12-15 and registration opens on 2024-12-01. The price is $60 and I can accommodate 60 people. I click publish and now an event is made where people can join the waiting list and they get this basic information. Also a QR code is generated that will lead them to this page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to sign my partner up to piano lessons, they need to learn how to play if they are going to play piano with me. I go to the app, I find my local rec center, I see they have listed piano lessons for beginners, and it is open to register for 2 more days. I click register. 2 days later when it is closed the system samples people, but not me. It notifies me that I was sampled</p>
