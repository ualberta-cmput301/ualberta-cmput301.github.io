<p>Warning: This is subject to change!</p>
<p>You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.</p>
<p>We want a mobile application that allows task requesters to post the tasks they would like done by task providers. For example, a task could be giving a ride in a car or delivering a package, within the city.</p>
<p>In general, a user of the app could be both a task requester and a task provider. A task provider can offer their service by making a monetary bid on a task. The task requester can accept a bid, so the task is assigned to the winning task provider. The task requester can denote when the task is done.</p>
<h4 id="needs-in-partial-user-story-form">Needs in (Partial) User Story Form</h4>
<p>User needs are expressed in the form of partial user stories:</p>
