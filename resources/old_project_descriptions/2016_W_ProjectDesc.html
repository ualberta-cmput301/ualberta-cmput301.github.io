<p>Warning: This is subject to change!</p>
<p>You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.
We want a mobile application that allows owners to record the things they have and share them with borrowers. For example, a thing could be a good (like a piece of camera equipment), a service (like giving a ride in a car), or a resource (like a parking spot). Generally, a thing should be something reusable and typical underused. It is up to each team to choose some specific thing of focus, with approval from the TA.</p>
<p>In general, a user can be both an owner of their own things and a borrower of someone else's things. A borrower can borrow a thing by making a monetary bid for it. The owner can accept a bid, so the thing becomes borrowed. The owner can denote when a borrowed thing is returned and available again.</p>
<h4 id="needs-in-partial-user-story-form">Needs in (Partial) User Story Form</h4>
<p>User needs are expressed in the form of partial user stories:
