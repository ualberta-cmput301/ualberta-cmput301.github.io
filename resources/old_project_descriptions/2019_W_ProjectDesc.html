<p>Warning: This is subject to change!</p>
<p>You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.</p>
<p>We want a mobile application that allows owners to record the books they have and loan them to borrowers.</p>
<p>In general, a user can be both an owner of their own books and a borrower of someone else's books. A borrower can borrow an available book by making a request for it. The owner can accept such a request. When the book is handed over, the book becomes borrowed. The owner can denote when a borrowed book is returned and available again.</p>

<p>User needs are expressed in the form of partial user stories:</p>
