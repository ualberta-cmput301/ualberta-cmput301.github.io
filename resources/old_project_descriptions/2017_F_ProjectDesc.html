<p>You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the follow goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.
To assist in forming good habits, we want a mobile application that allows one to track, encourage, and share their habits. Recurring habits could be, for example, "write a joke", "eat breakfast", "exercise dog", "call family", and "no car accident". The intent is to make such habits: regular (e.g., daily), unbroken (so missed habit events are noted), and shared (so there's public pressure not to miss).</p>
