<p><strong>Warning: This is subject to change!</strong>
You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.
We want a mobile application that allows drivers to search for recent ride requests, and for riders to post requests for rides. Riders will describe the start and end of their ride and their suggested payment. Drivers will browse for nearby requests and accept ride requests that they are willing to fulfil.</p>
<p>In general, a user can be both a driver and a rider.</p>
