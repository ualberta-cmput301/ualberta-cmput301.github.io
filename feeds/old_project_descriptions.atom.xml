&lt;p&gt;You are to design and implement an attractive, usable, interactive Java application to help satisfy the following user's goals. Your design should be flexible enough to allow future developers to add new types of entries (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="needs-in-partial-user-story-form"&gt;Needs In (Partial) User Story Form&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These needs are expressed in the form of partial user stories:
as a &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal&gt;
as a &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal&gt; so that &lt;reason&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These description may change in minor ways to correct omissions and clarify noticed issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to keep a record of my daily fitness-related activities in a journal so that I can monitor my progress. Types of entries include cardio workouts (i.e., outdoor cycling), strength workouts (i.e., free weights), and comment. There may be multiple, reorderable entries per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to see the entries for a single day, and move backwards and forwards one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to see the entries for the days of four weeks at a time, and move backwards and forwards one week at a time. A week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to be able to add, edit, and delete entries, including instant, multiple undo and redo of these changes (at the level of entries), so that I can freely make changes at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want data entry to be quick and structured, yet not unduly fussy. This is especially important if I happen to be using the application during a strength workout to keep track of exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to obtain help, so that I can learn what tasks I can do and what a data field is intended for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want a comment entry to record a non-workout activity or general observation. Typical uses would be, for example, to note a meal, a weight measure, a waist measure, a resting heart rate measure, a soreness, a sickness, fatigue, mood, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want each outdoor cycling workout to include the following information: trip distance (in km, to 2 decimal places), trip time (in hh:mm:ss format), average speed (in km/h, to 2 decimal places), average cadence (in whole revolutions/min), and maximum speed (in km/h, to 2 decimal places). This data will be entered manually, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want each outdoor cycling workout to include the following optional weather-related information: temperature (in whole degrees Celsius), wind speed (in whole km/h), and direction (one of 16 compass points). This data will be entered manually, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want each cardio workout to include the following information: time in zone (in hh:mm:ss format), zone start (in whole beats/min), zone end (in whole beats/min), average heart rate (in whole beats/min), peak heart rate (in whole beats/min), and calories expended (in whole kcal). This data will be entered manually, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to name and specify preset heart rate values of up to 5 heart rate zones, so that I can choose a named zone to quickly fill in the values for the zone start and end in a cardio workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want each free-weight workout to include for each exercise, the exercise name (required), number of sets (optional), number of reps (optional), and amount of weight (optional).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want each strength workout to include the time duration in hh:mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to specify a workout in advance to remind me what activity to do on a particular day. I can delete the workout should it not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to have a plan for a workout, detailing a particular goal or set of exercises. After the workout, I can rate the workout (0 to 5) on how well I achieved that goal or completed the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to avoid reentering plan details if different workouts will have the same plan. Also plans for different workout types should not be mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to add a free-form note to a workout, containing anything else that doesn't belong to one of the existing data fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to have a brief free-form note for a week, so that I can specify the cardio and/or strength goal or phase for that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to see (as needed) a chart of outdoor cycling total trip distances covered in each month for a given year and previous year compared. It should be possible to have this chart visible as workouts are edited. If there is no data for a particular year, omit that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to see (as needed) a chart of outdoor cycling total trip times done in each month for a given year and previous year compared. It should be possible to have this chart visible as workouts are edited. If there is no data for a particular year, omit that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to see the outdoor cycling total trip distance covered and total trip time done so far in the current year compared to that of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id="users-problem-description"&gt;User's Problem Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to my doctor and had a physical. It was embarassing. The doctor pointed out some spots and asked if I had seen them before. I wasn't sure, so neither put pushed the issue any further. We didn't know, so we weren't going to do anything. Another time I went to the doctor and had the doctor investigate a spot on my hand. The doctor asked me if it had changed, I wasn't sure. The doctor asked me if it had grown, I said I assume so because why am I noticing it now. The doctor shrugged, said it looked alright and told me to keep track of it. Come back if it changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember if it changes, to prove something changed I need evidence. I could take photos of my whole body and keep them in a safe place, but would I remember to take the photos again and consistently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I want software that will run on my phone and allow me to take photos of skin issues I might have. These photos will be for my own sanity as well I can provide them to physicians when they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I the user want to be able to track and document changes that occur on my skin. I want to use my cellphone to help me document all the blemishes and marks on my skin such that I can keep track of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="needs-in-partial-user-story-form"&gt;Needs in (Partial) User Story Form&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User needs are expressed in the form of partial user stories:
as a &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal&gt;
as a &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal&gt; so that &lt;reason&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These descriptions may change to correct omissions and clarify noticed issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to keep a visual log of any skin conditions I might . The purpose could be to gather a personal history of  a medical condition as to provide evidence to a physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want pictures I take to be stored so that I may recall them and view them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want all pictures I take to be timestamped so that I can measure the time between photos and know when an event occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want a method to organize these pictures so that I can view pictures of the same bit of skin over time and see if there is any progression or growth. For instance I might want to organize some photos that are related to my "gross mole that occurs on my right hand".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user if I have an organizational tag or group, I want to be able to add photos to that group so that I can further track the progression of something relevant to that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to be able to review any photos I have taken and view them so that I can see any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want some method of helping me take consistent photos, so that when I show the doctor any progression such as the growth of a mole is evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I should be able to retake photos I am taking, if I fail to take the photo I want to correct, so that I don't have erroneous photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I should be able to compare pictures in some manner, so that I can personally inspect them for differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="new-needs-for-project-part-4-in-partial-user-story-form"&gt;New Needs for Project Part 4 in (Partial) User Story Form&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I am worried that if my phone gets stolen people will see my photos. I want my photos secured via a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I am worried that if my phone gets stolen people will extract my photos and view them. I want my photos encrypted on the phone so if someone accesses the file system the image data should be encrypted so
they can't extract the jpegs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want notifications about when I should take photos again. I'm forgetful and being told every so often to take new photos would be helpful. Certain photos I don't have to retake again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I would like to control the rate, per blemish/set of photos that the notifications occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to email a set of photos to my physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user, I want to extract a set of the photos into an archive on my
SDCard so I can share them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user I would like to annotate images with annotations to describe
the scenario that I made this photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user I would like to tag the images so I can query the image by tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user I would like to browse the photos in different ways, by time, by tag, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Doctor, I want to use this application to record information about my own patients. Thus I need to organize blemishes and photo collection per patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Doctor, I want to browse my patient photos in different ways, by time, by tag, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep recipes, but I also want to find recipes, eventually I found similar people had similar goals. Some people wanted recipes they could execute immediately given what they had in their fridge or pantry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a system where I can record, post, search and download recipes. I want such a system to be able to address the food I have in my pantry and refridgerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to include photos of said recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want the system to query the recipes system with ingredients I already have and have it suggest appropriate recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore it should be easy to share these recipes over email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each group now has its own personal prefix on the elastisearch. Your Android application can communicate to your group's webservice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binaries should be small, and you can post them, but be sure you read up on how to send binaries to elastisearch  http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/core-types.html http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-put-mapping.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This webservice is meant to allow posting, listing, deleting and searching recipes. It has a JSON format that can be defined by your group in order to encode more difficult tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binaries should be small, and you can post them, but be sure you read up on how to send binaries to elastisearch  Core-types , Put Mappings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This webservice is meant to allow posting, listing, deleting and searching recipes. It has a JSON format that can be defined by your group in order to encode more difficult tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.
We want a mobile application that allows owners to record the things they have and share them with borrowers. For example, a thing could be a good (like a piece of camera equipment), a service (like giving a ride in a car), or a resource (like a parking spot). Generally, a thing should be something reusable and typical underused. It is up to each team to choose some specific thing of focus, with approval from the TA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a user can be both an owner of their own things and a borrower of someone else's things. A borrower can borrow a thing by making a monetary bid for it. The owner can accept a bid, so the thing becomes borrowed. The owner can denote when a borrowed thing is returned and available again.&lt;/p&gt;

To assist in forming good habits, we want a mobile application that allows one to track, encourage, and share their habits. Recurring habits could be, for example, "write a joke", "eat breakfast", "exercise dog", "call family", and "no car accident".

&lt;p&gt;Warning: This is subject to change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="users-problem-description"&gt;User's Problem Description&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to my doctor and had a physical. It was embarassing. The doctor pointed out some spots and asked if I had seen them before. I wasn't sure, so neither put pushed the issue any further. We didn't know, so we weren't going to do anything. Another time I went to the doctor and had the doctor investigate a spot on my hand. The doctor asked me if it had changed, I wasn't sure. The doctor asked me if it had grown, I said I assume so because why am I noticing it now. The doctor shrugged, said it looked alright and told me to keep track of it. Come back if it changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember if it changes, to prove something changed I need evidence. I could take photos of my whole body and keep them in a safe place, but would I remember to take the photos again and consistently? I also would like to take notes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I want software that will run on my phone and allow me to take photos of skin issues and notes about medical issues I might have. These photos and notes will be for my own sanity as well I can provide them to physicians when they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each photo or note should be timestamped and associated with a problem. Each photo or note should optionally be mapped to a location. Each photo or note should be associated with a location on my body which I can indicate by clicking on paper-doll-cut-out-like image of myself. So if my left arm was affected, I'd click on my left arm on a picture of myself--that body location would recorded. If I suffer headaches near smokestacks I probably want to record the GPS location as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus as a user I want to be able to track and document medical issues. I want to use my cellphone to help me document all the blemishes and marks, and other stuff on my body such that I can keep track of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="needs-in-partial-user-story-form"&gt;Needs in (Partial) User Story Form&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want a mobile application that allows task requesters to post the tasks they would like done by task providers. For example, a task could be giving a ride in a car or delivering a package, within the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a user of the app could be both a task requester and a task provider. A task provider can offer their service by making a monetary bid on a task. The task requester can accept a bid, so the task is assigned to the winning task provider. The task requester can denote when the task is done.&lt;/p&gt;

Recurring habits could be, for example, "write a joke", "eat breakfast", "exercise dog", "call family", and "no car accident".

&lt;p&gt;You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want a mobile application that allows crowd-sourced testing of phenomona. There are 4 kinds of crowd-sourced tests: counts (how many did you see), binomial trials (pass fail), non-negative integer counts (each trial has 0 or more), measurement trials (like the temperature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count-based tests are about how many of something a person observed, it could be blue cars. Everytime they see a blue car they add 1 to the count seen. For instance you want to crowdsource how many blue cars are seen in Edmonton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binomial trials are trials where there's a chance to pass or fail. Users will repeat these trials and indicate pass or success. It could be a series of trials where you try to flip a water bottle upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-negative integer counts are trials where each trial results in a non-negative integer results (usually a count). Such as if I drop a carton of eggs, how many eggs survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurement trials are repeated measurements and you record a decimal value of whatever was measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chief experimenter (owner) describes and proposes a trial, gives rules and constraints that crowd experimenters will follow when they execute the trials. The crowd experimenters will look for trials that interest them, subscribe to trials and help execute and record trials for these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warning: This is subject to change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want a mobile application that allows us to hunt for the coolest QR codes that score the most points. Players will run around scanning QR codes, barcodes, etc. trying to find barcodes and QR codes that give them the most points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QR codes and barcodes (scannable codes) will be hashed and the hashes they produce will be analyzed and scored. A QR code that has certain properties like repeated nibbles or bytes (hex digits) will have a higher score than a QR code that does not. We have a proposed scoring system, but the implementers are free to use a different scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want users to compete with each other for the highest scoring QR codes, the most QR codes, the highest sum of QR codes, or highest scoring QR codes in a region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a player scans a QR code they will take a photo of what or where the QR code is and also record the geolocation of the QR code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players can see on a map local QR codes that other players have scanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="scenario"&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open my QRHunter app. I see a QR code in my wallet. I indicate I want to add a new QR code and I use the phone camera to add the QR code. The QR code is scored and I’m told that my QR score is 30. The system prompts me for a photo of the object I scanned. I decline since this was an ID card. I also decline geolocation because it is in my wallet. The system adds the 30 points to my total score and records a hash of the QR code. I then see some sticker on a pole. I scan it and am told it is worth 1000 points! I record the geolocation and take a photo of the pole and save it to my account. 1000 points wow. Then I see that other users have found this pole as well. So I open the map for nearby QR codes and I see something worth 10000 is 100 meters away so I’m going to head on over there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="proposed-scoring-system"&gt;Proposed Scoring System:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we calculate a SHA-256 hash of the QR code contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QR code contents: &lt;strong&gt;BFG5DGW54&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating SHA-256 hash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@slate:~$ echo BFG5DGW54 | sha256sum
696ce4dbd7bb57cbfe58b64f530f428b74999cb37e2ee60980490cd9552de3a6  -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, based on the hexadecimal representation of the sha256, the score is calculated in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a "0" is 1 point&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many 0 in a row are multiplied by 20^(n-1) whereby n is the number of repeats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;00 - 20^1 - 20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;000 - 20^2 - 400&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0000 - 20^3 - 8000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same for other numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 - 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;111 - 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1111 - 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 - 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;222 - 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2222 - 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;99 - 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;999 - 81&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aa - 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aaa - 100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ff - 15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fff - 225&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the best QR code would be made of all 0s or higher digits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the QR code above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;696ce4dbd7bb57cbfe58b64f530f428b74999cb37e2ee60980490cd9552de3a6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s find the repeated digits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;echo BFG5DGW54 | sha256sum | perl -lpe 'print "$1$2" while /([0-9a-f])(\1+)/g'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bb
999
ee
55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And calculate the score&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bb - 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;999 - 9^2 - 81&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ee - 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55 - 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Score: 11 + 81 + 14 + 5 = 111&lt;/p&gt;
