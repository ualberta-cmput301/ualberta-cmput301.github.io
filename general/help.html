<p>Ask questions well before Assignment due dates. Although you have nothing to lose by trying, realize that while the course staff try to provide as much support as possible, they are not obliged to answer last-minute questions (i.e., those within less than 2 business days from the assignment due date). </p>
<p>Please be polite, courteous, and professional. Follow the <a href="https://ualberta-cmput301.github.io/general/online_etiquette_guidelines.pdf">online etiquette guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>We will not tolerate harassment, bullying, threats, intimidation, insults, lying, or creating any kind of environment that might discourage participation. Any such behaviour is a violation of the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=190&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Conduct Policy</a> and subject to sanctions. Plagiarism, cheating, and lying are also violations of the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Academic Integrity Policy</a>, and will be subject to sanctions.</p>

<p>Unless your question is personal (E.g., you are feeling unwell and require an EA, you have a question about your mark), all questions should be posted on the Discussion Forum first. Please do not share code from your implementations (configuration settings are OK). </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not post your code. <ul>
<li>Configuration settings are OK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not post your solutions.</li>

<li>You can attend the <strong>office hours of a TA.</strong></li>
<li>You can attend the office hours of your instructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your question is related to implementation/configuration issues in the projects/assignments, the TAs are best suited to help you. You can attend TA office hours remotely. <strong>TAs do not provide help outside of Labs and Scheduled Office Hours.</strong></p>
<p>If your question is related to content covered in class, and you need further explanation, please post on the discussion forum.</p>
<p>TAs are not allowed to change your marks. If you disagree with your marks, <a href="#contact-instructor">contact instructor</a> instead.</p>

<h3 id="contact-instructor">Contact Instructor</h3>
<!--<span style="font-size: 200%">üîó</span> Do not email the instructor. Use the [contact instructor form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMcgrLR4nCgfK1qJW9P5sDJp3-sTnQ9hKC94H7wojdaPaTjw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  -->

<p>If you email the instructor about an issue that doesn't fit on the canvas discussion forum, you must include CMPUT301 at the start of the subject line for the email. Any email without CMPUT301 at the front of the subject line will likely be immediately lost.</p>
<p>Replies may take several days because there are hundreds of students. Currently, there are more than 600 students. If you are asking about something that isn't due yet (before due date) please ask a TA instead, or use the discussion forum. You might not get a response before the due date. You will not get an extension, even if the instructor does not reply before the due date.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-to-not-get-help">Where to NOT get help</h3>
<p class="warning">Do not ask for help on sites such as Discord, Telegram, WeChat, Snapchat... Ask on the <a href="#discussion-forum">Discussion Forum</a> instead! Or ask a TA!</p>

<p>The only official communications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>University of Alberta Google Apps (forms / gmail / etc.) (you must be signed in with your CCID)</li>
<li>Canvas University of Alberta </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can submit assignments/projects/labs/participation on GitHub Classroom and Mentimeter, but do not use them to ask questions.</p>
<p>The instructor/TA are not responsible for and completely disown any unofficial communications.</p>
<p>People on unofficial discussion forums such as discord <strong>sometimes lie</strong>. There is no way to verify the people on Discord are even actually in the class. Previously on unofficial communications like Discord:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple times, someone lied about a due date was later than it was, leading to students missing deadline and getting a zero.</li>
<li>Multiple times, Someone lied about something being required that was not, leading to students doing extra work for no reason.</li>
<li>Multiple times, Someone lied about something not being required that actually was, leading to students failing assignments.</li>
<li>A student gave someone on discord access to their computer, leading to money from their bank account being stolen.</li>
<li>Multiple times, someone lied about an instructor retiring when they actually weren't.</li>
<li>Someone lied about something being impossible, when it was actually easy, leading to multiple students doing a bunch of extra work.</li>
<li>Multiple times, someone pasted code, leading to Plagiarism sanctions against multiple students by the University such as grade reductions, academic probation, being denied graduation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple lies like the above happen on Discord or another unofficial site for this class <strong>every semester</strong>.</p>
<p>Behaviour such as harassment, bullying, threats, intimidation, insults, racism, lying are still subject to sanctions by the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=190&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Conduct Policy</a> and the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Academic Integrity Policy</a>. However, because the instructor and University has no control of these platforms we also do not have any way to stop or control harassment, bullying, threats, intimidation, insults, racism, lying.</p>
