<h3 id="qr-code-event-check-in-system">QR Code Event Check-In System</h3>
<p>You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>Create an event management system where attendees check in using QR codes on their mobile devices. Organizers can track attendance, manage event details, and send notifications.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>QR Code Scanning:</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendees can use the app to scan event-specific QR codes for quick and seamless check-ins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firebase Integration:</li>
</ul>
<p>Utilize Firebase for storing event details, attendee lists, and real-time check-in status updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-User Interaction:</li>
</ul>
<p>Distinguish between organizers and attendees with different app roles and permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Geolocation Verification (Optional):</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally use geolocation to verify that attendees are physically present at the event location during check-in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Image Upload:</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow organizers to upload event posters and attendees to upload profile pictures for a more personalized experience.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario:</h3>
<p>Update for Project 3:</p>
<p>John, an event organizer, opens the QRCheckIn app for an upcoming tech conference. He generates a unique QR code for the event. Potential attendees browse the events and notice John's event, they view the event poster, and then click sign up to indicate they will attend the event as an attendee. As attendees arrive, they use the app to scan the QR code, automatically checking them into the conference. The app updates John's dashboard in real-time, showing the current attendance. John can also send push notifications to all attendees through the app.</p>
<p>Scenario for Project 2:
 John, an event organizer, opens the QRCheckIn app for an upcoming tech conference. He generates a unique QR code for the event. As attendees arrive, they use the app to scan the QR code, automatically checking them into the conference. The app updates John's dashboard in real-time, showing the current attendance. John can also send push notifications to all attendees through the app.</p>
<p># Actors:</p>
<p>Organizer: a person who organizes the event and is in control of an event</p>
<p>Attendee: a person who attends the event</p>
<p>Administrator: the entity that is responsible for the infrastructure that the game runs on.</p>
<h3 id="glossary">Glossary:</h3>
<p>QR Code: a scannable code, either a barcode, a QR code, or other code scannable by Zebra crossing libraries or google QR code scanning libraries.</p>
<h3 id="user-stories">User Stories:</h3>
<p>User needs are expressed in the form of partial user stories:</p>
