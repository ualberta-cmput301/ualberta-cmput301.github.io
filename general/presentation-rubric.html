<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of the presentation marking rubric is to outline precise evaluation criteria for the assessment of the group assignment 5 presentation. Its aim is to provide clear guidance to presenters, ensuring they have a thorough understanding of what is expected of them.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Slides<ul>
<li>Make sure to use readable fonts.</li>
<li>Use short phrases instead of paragraphs of text. Avoid crowded text-only slides.</li>
<li>Use pictures, diagrams etc., whenever possible.</li>
<li>Add slide numbers so that it is easy to ask questions about specific slides.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delivering the talk<ul>
<li>Be positive and (pretend to be?) interested and excited.</li>
<li>Speak loudly and clearly &amp; avoid being monotonous.</li>
<li>Face the audience and look at them and try to engage the audience.</li>
<li>Make your talk entertaining (without overdoing it).</li>
<li>Rehearse your presentation well enough that you don’t need to keep reading off your slides. If you are always reading off the slides, then  the audience could simply read your slides and not listen to you at all.</li>
<li>Anticipate things you need to highlight and use boxes etc to highlight them on the slides.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Present the project to the class<ul>
<li>Your presentation must be targeted to the audience who are in the class.</li>
<li>Presentations will be done by group.</li>
<li>Presentation should be about 8 minutes, no more. Try NOT to wrap up the presentation really early. You MUST finish your presentation within the time constraints so please rehearse properly. You will lose 2 marks if you run over time.</li>
<li>Presentation should cover all the aspects of group assignment 5 including the five points which should be in the report.</li>
<li>You can use PowerPoint or Google Slides or whatever presentation software you like.</li>
<li>You will need to present in lab in person during lab time.</li>
<li>All group members will have to present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must be able to answer questions about the presentation and your work so far<ul>
<li>You are expected to attend each other's presentations and ask questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
