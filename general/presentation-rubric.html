<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of the presentation marking rubric is to outline precise evaluation criteria for the assessment of the group assignment 5 presentation. Its aim is to provide clear guidance to presenters, ensuring they have a thorough understanding of what is expected of them.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Slides<ul>
<li>Make sure to use readable fonts.</li>
<li>Use short phrases instead of paragraphs of text. Avoid crowded text-only slides.</li>
<li>Use pictures, diagrams etc., whenever possible.</li>
<li>Add slide numbers so that it is easy to ask questions about specific slides.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delivering the talk<ul>
<li>Be positive and (pretend to be?) interested and excited.</li>
<li>Speak loudly and clearly &amp; avoid being monotonous.</li>
<li>Face the audience and look at them and try to engage the audience.</li>
<li>Make your talk entertaining (without overdoing it).</li>
<li>Rehearse your presentation well enough that you donâ€™t need to keep reading off your slides. If you are always reading off the slides, then  the audience could simply read your slides and not listen to you at all.</li>
<li>Anticipate things you need to highlight and use boxes etc to highlight them on the slides.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Present the project to the class<ul>
<li>Your presentation must be targeted to the audience who are in the class.</li>
<li>Presentations will be done by group.</li>
<li>Presentation should be about 8 minutes, no more. Try NOT to wrap up the presentation really early. You MUST finish your presentation within the time constraints so please rehearse properly. You will lose 2 marks if you run over time.</li>
<li>Presentation should cover all the aspects of group assignment 5 including the five points which should be in the report.</li>
<li>You can use PowerPoint or Google Slides or whatever presentation software you like.</li>
<li>You will need to present in lab in person during lab time.</li>
<li>All group members will have to present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must be able to answer questions about the presentation and your work so far<ul>
<li>You are expected to attend each other's presentations and ask questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
