**COURSE CONTENT**

**Calendar Description:**   
As an introduction to software engineering, this course is about building software effectively. You will apply good practices, effective design techniques, and development tools within a team project to create an application with a graphical user interface.

The focus is largely practical, with broad coverage in topics such as: object-oriented design, user interfaces, unit testing, design patterns, and refactoring.

Communication skills, team dynamics, working with a "customer", and creativity are also important factors in the course project. The knowledge, skills, and experience you gain will be invaluable in your future software development projects.

**Additional Course Information:**  
Course Prerequisites: CMPUT 201 or CMPUT 275

**Course Objectives and Expected Learning Outcomes:**  
We will learn about applying software engineering concepts to design and implement interactive applications.

One effective way to build such applications is to apply object-oriented design and use software components. To be useful to end users, the design of these applications must also be guided by usability principles. The course involves a team project in building a well-designed Java/Android application with a sophisticated graphical user interface.

By the end of this course, you will have a strong background in basic software engineering concepts. Also, you will have the skills to implement interactive applications in Android. You will learn to propose and think critically about software and user interface designs.

Students are expected to participate in all classes and labs.

**Access to Past or Representative Evaluative Material:**
Past materials are located on the CMPUT 301 GitHub webpage:
https://ualberta-cmput301.github.io/general/resources.html

**Statement of Expectations for AI Use:**  
You MUST not submit work by LLMs as your own, that is plagiarism. This also applies to other "AI" and Generative Models: ChatGPT, Lex, Page, DALL-E2, Google BARD/Gemini, Microsoft Bing/Copilot, and others. If you use LLMs you must cite it. This includes the corporation that made the AI, the AI, Subject, and Date. For example:

If you use LLMs you must cite it, but it's probably better to Google what it tells you and find a real citation because:

**LLMs like ChatGPT are wrong a lot.** It does not understand computer science. It understands how to form sentences and paragraphs well enough to be convincing, but it doesn't actually understand what anything it is saying means. When it has the choice between two answers, with opposite meanings, it will pick the answer that looks more like things it has seen before, not the answer that is more correct. This means you need to double-check that what it tells you is actually correct.

**StackOverflow is always a better resource** than Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard/Gemini, etc., but of course if you use code from StackOverflow or any other website, **you must cite it.** This is because other human programmers will usually check and downvote, remove, or fix bad information on StackOverflow. No one is checking the output of LLMs: if an LLM lies to you, no one will ever know.

ChatGPT and similar services are recording everything you tell it, and tracking you. Using ChatGPT/Bing/Bard etc. they are recording everything you say and how the LLM responds to you. There is no privacy.

* ChatGPT example from CMPUT 229:  
  1. Me: "What is the difference between the b and j pseudoinstruction in RISC-V?"  
  2. ChatGPT: "... The b instruction is actually a shorthand for the more general beq (branch if equal) instruction, which compares two registers and branches if they are equal. However, \> \> in the case of b, one of the registers is always x0 (the zero register), so the comparison \> is always false, effectively causing an unconditional jump. ...the key difference between b \> and j is that b is a relative branch instruction that jumps to a location within a limited range, while j is an absolute jump instruction that can jump to any address within the range of the program counter."  
* There are 3 problems with this answer:  
  1. b is not shorthand for beq: RARS replaces it with jal \-- the actual replacement depends on the assembler used and the situation it is used in.  
  2. This also makes ChatGPT's conclusion about relative limited range jumps and absolute jumps wrong. All jumps and branches in RISC-V are relative, short range jumps except jalr. RARS also (at least in every case I've seen) translates j to jal, not jalr, and jal is also a short-range, relative jump.  
  3. If b gets translated to beq x0, Y, label then what guarantees that the other register isn't also zero? The comparison with beq x0, Y cannot always be false, despite what ChatGPT claimed. This really doesn't make any sense. It would make more sense for it to be translated to bne x0, x0, label ... but that's the opposite instruction of what ChatGPT claimed.

**Re-evaluation of Term Work:**  
Re-Evaluation of Term Work follows the [Computing Science department course policies](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/resources/policy-information/department-course-policies.html). Any questions or concerns about marks on a particular assignment must be brought to the attention of the instructor *(not a TA)* within 7 calendar days of its return date. After that, we will not consider remarking or re-evaluating the work. So do not expect anyone to re-evaluate all the work you did all term long in the hopes of getting a higher final grade.

However, clerical errors such as incorrectly computing or recording a mark may be raised at any time prior to 2 business days following the final exam. It is the student's responsibility to confirm that their term work has been recorded properly.

**POLICIES FOR LATE AND MISSED WORK**

**Late Policies:**

**Absence Form:**  
This course uses a Google form to request excused absences for term work. This form needs to be filled out by students if they wish to request an excused absence for any deliverable. Emails to instructors or TAs **will not be accepted** as timely notification for an excused absence.

**Missed Term Work/Final Exam Due to Non-medical Protected Grounds (e.g., religious beliefs):**  
When a term assessment or final exam presents a conflict based on [non-medical protected grounds](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/current-students/academic-success-centre/accessibility-resources/register/eligibility.html), students must apply to the Academic Success Centre for accommodations via their [Register for Accommodations](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/current-students/academic-success-centre/accessibility-resources/register/index.html) website. Students can review their eligibility and choose the application process specific for Accommodations Based on Non-medical Protected Grounds.

It is imperative that students review the dates of all course assessments upon receipt of the course syllabus, and apply AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to ensure the timely application of the accommodation. Students who apply later in the term may experience unavoidable delays in the processing of the application, which can affect the accommodation.

**Missed Labs:**   
Labs are due Friday at 5PM on the same week the lab was presented. Project meetings are due at the time of the meeting, and they are included in the lab mark. Failure to attend and actively participate in project meetings will result in a lab mark of zero.

The 2 lowest marks for Labs (including project meetings) will be dropped when calculating the course mark. No late labs will be accepted. Failure to complete a lab (or to attend a project meeting) on time for any reason will result in a mark of zero. Please note that you can miss 2 labs (or project meetings) without penalty.

**Missed Lecture Participation:**  
Participation exercises will be available at most lectures.

The 6 lowest marks for lecture participation will be dropped when calculating the course mark. No late participation will be accepted. Failure to complete a participation exercise on time for any reason will result in a mark of zero. Please note that you can miss 6 lectures without penalty.

**Missed Assignments, Project Parts, Quizzes, Midterm Exams:**  
A student who cannot complete an assignment, project part, quiz, or midterm exam, due to incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction or other compelling reasons must contact the instructor within two business days of missing the assessment, or as soon as possible, to request an excused absence using the absence form. If an excused absence is granted, then weight will be transferred to the next Midterm exam. An excused absence is a privilege and not a right. There is no guarantee that an absence will be excused. Misrepresentation of facts to gain an excused absence is a serious breach of the Student Academic Integrity Policy. In all cases, instructors may request adequate documentation to substantiate the reason for the absence at their discretion.

Failure to complete an assignment or contribute to a project part without an excused absence will result in a raw score of zero or a proportional score reduction.

**Additional information regarding missed Midterm Exams:**  
If either of the first two Midterm exams are missed, then a student may apply within 2 calendar days to move the weight of the exam to the next Midterm exam. If Midterm 3 is missed, then it will be replaced by a deferred exam that will include an oral examination component. The time of this deferred \+ oral exam will be determined individually between student and instructor.

**STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES**

**Academic Integrity and Student Conduct:**   
The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty, as well as maintaining a learning environment that fosters the safety, security, and inherent dignity of each member of the community, ensuring students conduct themselves accordingly. Students are expected to be familiar with the standards of academic honesty and appropriate student conduct, and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect.

Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the [Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alfresco/uappol/academic/student-academic-integrity/policy/student-academic-integrity-policy.pdf) and the [Student Conduct Policy](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alfresco/uappol/academic/student-conduct/policy/student-conduct-policy.pdf), and avoid any behaviour that could potentially result in suspicions of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts, participation in an offence) and non-academic misconduct (e.g., discrimination, harassment, physical assault). Academic and non-academic misconduct are taken very seriously and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University.

All students are expected to consult the [Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alfresco/uappol/academic/student-academic-integrity/policy/student-academic-integrity-policy.pdf) for clarification on the various academic offences. All forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable at the University. Unfamiliarity of the rules, procrastination or personal pressures are not acceptable excuses for committing an offence. Listen to your instructor, be a good person, ask for help when you need it, and do your own work \-- this will lead you toward a path to success. Any academic integrity concern in this course will be reported to the College of Natural and Applied Sciences.

Suspected cases of non-academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Student Success and Experience. The College, the Faculty, and the Dean of Students are committed to student rights and responsibilities, and adhere to due process and administrative fairness, as outlined in the [Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alfresco/uappol/academic/student-academic-integrity/policy/student-academic-integrity-policy.pdf) and the [Student Conduct Policy](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alfresco/uappol/academic/student-conduct/policy/student-conduct-policy.pdf). Please refer to the policy websites for details on inappropriate behaviours and possible sanctions.

The College of Natural and Applied Sciences (CNAS) has created an [Academic Integrity for CNAS Students](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/course/view.php?id=88399) eClass site. Students can self enroll and review the various resources provided, including the importance of academic integrity, examples of academic misconduct and possible sanctions, and the academic misconduct and appeal process. They can also complete assessments to test their knowledge and earn a completion certificate.

*"Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching"* \-- C.S. Lewis

**Contract Cheating and Misuse of University Academic Materials or Other Assets:**  
Contract cheating describes the form of academic dishonesty where students get academic work completed on their behalf, which they submit for academic credit as if they had created it themselves. Contract cheating may or may not involve the payment of a fee to a third party, who then creates the work for the student.

Examples include:

1. Getting someone to write an essay or research paper for you.  
2. Getting someone to complete your assignment or exam for you.  
3. Posting an essay, assignment, or exam question to a tutorial or study website; the question is answered by a "content expert", then you copy it and submit it as your own answer.  
4. Posting your solutions to a tutorial/study website, public server, or group chat and/or copying solutions that were posted to a tutorial/study website, public server, or group chat.  
5. Sharing your login credentials to the course management system (e.g., Canvas) and allowing someone else to complete your assignment or exam remotely.  
6. Using an artificial intelligence bot or text generator tool to complete your essay, research paper, assignment, or exam solutions for you (without the instructor's permission).  
7. Using an online grammar checker to "fix" your essay, research paper, assignment, or exam solutions for you (without the instructor's permission).

Contract cheating companies thrive on making students believe that they cannot succeed without their help; they attempt to convince students that cheating is the only way to succeed.

Uploading the instructor's teaching materials (e.g., course outlines, lecture slides, assignment, or exam questions, etc.) to tutorial, study, or note-sharing websites or public servers is a copyright infringement and constitutes the misuse of University academic materials or other assets. Receiving assignment solutions or answers to exam questions from an unauthorized source puts you at risk of receiving inaccurate information.

Receiving assignment solutions or answers to exam questions from an unauthorized source puts you at risk of receiving inaccurate information.

**Additional Examples of Contract Cheating:**

| Logging in as someone else Sharing your login credentials Sharing your anonymous ID Using someone else's anonymous ID Allowing someone else to log in as you Representing yourself as someone else Having someone else represent themselves as you | On other UAlberta services and linked services: Zoom gmail Google Chat, Drive, ... Lab computers Wi-Fi ... On an external service, website, or app: repository hosting services: GitHub, GitHub Classroom, Bitbucket, GitLab, ... live quiz services: Mentimeter, ... Textbook websites/apps KnowledgeTree/MasteryGrids online tutorials online practice systems online homework systems |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

* Misrepresenting authorship to a version control system such as git:  
  * Forging git commit metadata (author, time, etc.)  
  * Creating git commits where the author recorded did not create the changes being committed.  
  * ...  
* Submitting participation exercises for someone else.  
* Representing yourself as someone else, or having someone else represent themselves as you to an instructor, TA, or other UA employee.  
  * Attending a lecture/lab/seminar for someone else.  
  * Having someone else attend a lecture/lab/seminar for you.

**Appropriate Collaboration:**  
Students need to be able to recognize when they have crossed the line between appropriate collaboration and inappropriate collaboration. If students are unsure, they need to ask instructors to clarify what is allowed and what is not allowed.

Here are some tips to avoid copying on assessments:

1. Do not write down something that you cannot explain to your instructor.  
2. When you are helping other students, avoid showing them your work directly. Instead, explain your solution verbally. Allowing your work to be copied is also considered inappropriate collaboration.  
3. It is also possible that verbally discussing the solution in too much detail may result in written responses that are too similar. Try to keep discussions at a general or higher level.  
4. If you find yourself reading another student's solution, do not write anything down. Once you understand how to solve the problem, remove the other person's work from your sight and then write up the solution to the question yourself. Looking back and forth between someone else's paper and your own paper is almost certainly copying and considered inappropriate collaboration.  
5. If the instructor or TA writes down part of a solution in order to help explain it to you or the class, you cannot copy it and hand it in for credit. Treat it the same way you would treat another student's work with respect to copying, that is, remove the explanation from your sight and then write up the solution yourself.  
6. There is often more than one way to solve a problem. Choose the method that makes the most sense to you rather than the method that other students happen to use. If none of the ideas in your solution are your own, there is a good chance it will be flagged as copying.

For programming assignments, powerful software tools are used to detect plagiarism. When the software tools indicate that there is similarity between two submissions, the submissions are reviewed by the instructor or teaching assistant. If the possibility that the standards for academic honesty were violated is confirmed, an investigation is started. Eventually the submitted solutions may be forwarded to the Faculty of Science Associate Dean of Students for further investigation and eventual sanctions.

* Each student must be able to verbally describe their exam answers and code, line by line, to a professor or TA, if asked to do so. Your mark may be reduced if you aren't able to explain your own work satisfactorily.  
* For some substantial programming assignments and homework questions, students may discuss the concepts covered by the assignment with other students registered in the course as long as they do not share actual solutions or programming code.  
* All suspected cases of plagiarism will be forwarded to the Dean's office and thoroughly investigated. Receiving a low mark for work not completed is a far superior alternative to this process and its possible long-term consequences for your career.

All suspected cases of plagiarism and other forms of cheating are immediately referred to the College of Natural and Applied Sciences (CNAS). CNAS, not your instructor, will determine what course of action is appropriate. We do not hesitate to send ALL cases of cheating to CNAS. Please do not put yourself or us into such an unpleasant situation. Please read the Student Conduct Policy carefully.

**Citations:**  
If you include code or ideas from someone who isn't you (including from a Generative AI or LLM) you must cite it. Here are examples of an appropriate citation:

**Collaboration policy definitions:**  
The following are definitions for the different collaboration policies used in this course

**Solo Effort:**  
Participation exercises fall under the department's *Solo Effort* model unless announced by the instructor. *Solo Effort* must be completed by the student registered in the course without external assistance from any individual or organization.

* Students may only submit work authored by themselves.  
* Students **may not** discuss or exchange solutions, steps, strategies, code, links, code, images, videos, output, comments, repositories, answers, etc.  
* Students **may not** consult with other students on how to solve the problem, unlike the consultation model described below.  
* Students **may not** submit a participation exercise, quiz, or exam without attending the relevant lecture, lab, seminar, or exam.  
* Students **may not** share a participation exercise, quiz, or exam link (URL).  
* Students **may not** represent themselves as someone else, (or have someone else represent themselves as the student) during lectures, labs, seminars, or exams.  
  * Including in-person or over Zoom, or any other remote video, voice call, chat, or email service.  
  * See Contract Cheating above.

Violation of the above will be considered a breach of the [Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193&s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx).

**Confidential:**  
Midterms and Final Exams are also *Confidential* in addition to *Solo Effort* as listed above.

* Students **may not** discuss the contents of the exam, except with instructors.  
  * Students are not always able to take the exam at the same time, so do not discuss the contents of the exam even if you have already taken it\!  
* No human, computer, electronic assistance is allowed of any sort, including AI chatbots, calculators, tutors, etc.

**Consultation:**  
Individual assignments and labs are under the department's Consultation model. That means you may discuss the labs with others, but you must create and submit a solution that is entirely your own work. If you consult with other students, you must list their names in a comment at the top of your submission or in your repository README, along with a brief description of the part(s) of the assignment you discussed.

How to consult with other students without plagiarizing:

* Study the Course, Computing Science Department, CNAS, and University policies listed above regarding Academic Integrity.  
* All sources used must be cited.  
  * If you use code snippets you must cite them, please see the examples above.  
  * All sources of information used, e.g., books, websites, students you talked to etc., must be cited in your submitted file or repo README for each assignment.  
  * If student A cites student B, then B should also cite A as consulted.  
* Individually develop your own solution for assignments and exercises. Submit only your own work for evaluation.  
  * Each student is responsible for what is handed-in and must be able to explain it.  
  * Students may only submit work authored by themselves. Work submitted by a student that is the work of someone else (e.g. another student or a tutor) either in part or in entirety is considered plagiarism.  
* You can freely discuss the steps and solutions with your classmates on a conceptual verbal level.  
* Limit discussion to be among students taking the current course, not students who took in earlier terms or other students. Consultation is a two-way process that benefits both sides.  
* Do not exchange any text, code, images, videos, output, comments, repositories, or detailed (low-level) step-by-step procedures.  
  * Do not share solutions.  
* Do not give other students access to your solutions and do not seek access to other's solutions. This is considered plagiarism.  
  * Do not show your code to classmates.  
  * Do not look at a classmate's code.

Examples of consultation:

* Acceptable consultation example:  
  * Student A has a problem with the code  
  * Student A asks Student B for help  
  * Student B explains the steps, concepts, or techniques they used to get their code working  
  * **Student A understands the fix**  
  * **Student A can reproduce and explain the fix.**  
  * Student A submits the code  
* Acceptable consultation example:  
  * Student A needs to make a grid for a board game program.  
  * Student A asks Student B for help.  
  * Student B explains that they "used two nested for loops, one for the vertical and one for the horizontal."  
  * Student A implements two nested for loops using their own unique code.  
  * Student A can use the for loops to fix similar problems, and they **can explain why each piece of code is needed, along with how it works to solve the problem**.  
  * Student A submits the code  
* Unacceptable consultation example:  
  * Student A needs to make a grid for a board game program.  
  * Student A asks Student B for help.  
  * Student B sends the code they used to make the board game grid for their solution.  
  * Student A copies Student B's code into their own solution, changing it a little.  
  * Student A submits the code

* Unacceptable plagiarism example:  
  * Student A has a problem with the code  
  * Student A asks Student B for help  
  * Student B provides Student A with the code  
  * Student A submits the code

**Teamwork:**

* As long as you are a part of a group, you are responsible for everything in the group project, whether you participated in every component or not.  
* A group may only submit work authored by group members or appropriately cited and credited code that does not violate the author's license.

**Intellectual Violence:**  
In this course, Intellectual Violence is considered bullying. Intellectual violence is when one teammate uses their skill, knowledge, or experience, to intimidate or control the other teammate(s) rather than sharing and helping them learn. Examples of Intellectual Violence

* Using complex terminology or concepts to make others feel inferior.  
* Dismissing or ridiculing colleagues’ ideas or contributions.  
* Withholding information to maintain a power imbalance.  
* Creating an environment where only certain knowledge or skills are valued.  
* Rejecting contributions without constructive feedback.  
* Imposing overly strict code standards.  
* Ignoring or delaying code reviews, pull requests, or commits.  
* Favouring contributions from certain team members.  
* Using harsh or condescending language in comments, code reviews, pull requests, issues, commit messages, etc.  
* Making contributors feel unwelcome.

Instances of Intellectual Violence may result in reduced marks and/or be referred to the Dean of Students under the Student Conduct Policy.

**Exam Conduct:**   
Please refer to the [Examinations](https://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=56&navoid=18647#examinations-exams) section of the Academic Calendar for more details on Conduct of Exams. 

Some key points to be aware of:

* Your student photo ID is required at exams to verify your identity.  
* Students must arrive at the specified time to take the exam. Once the exam has started, students must remain in the physical in-person or remote environment for at least 30 minutes. Students who arrive more than 30 minutes late for an in-person exam will not be permitted to take the exam. Students who arrive more than 30 minutes late for an online exam may have their exam attempt removed or disqualified by the instructor. In both cases, students may apply for a deferred examination.  
* All cell phones must be turned off and stored in your bags.

**Accommodations for Students:**  
In accordance with the University of Alberta’s [Discrimination, Harassment, and Duty to Accommodate policy](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alfresco/uappol/humanresources/discrimination-harassment-and-duty-to-accommodate/policy/discrimination-harassment-and-duty-to-accommodate-policy.pdf), accommodation support is available to eligible students who encounter limitations or restrictions to their ability to perform the daily activities necessary to pursue studies at a post-secondary level due to medical conditions and/or non-medical protected grounds. Accommodations are coordinated through the [Academic Success Centre](https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/academic-success-centre/index.html), and students can learn more about eligibility on the [Register for Accommodations website](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/current-students/academic-success-centre/accessibility-resources/register/index.html). 

It is recommended that students apply ***AS SOON AS POSSIBLE*** in order to ensure sufficient time to complete accommodation registration and coordination. Students are advised to review and adhere to published deadlines for accommodation approval and for specific accommodation requests (e.g., exam registration submission deadlines). Students who request accommodations less than a month in advance of the academic term for which they require accommodations may experience unavoidable delays or consequences in their academic programs, and may need to consider alternative academic schedules.

**Recording and/or Distribution of Course Materials:**  
Audio or video recording, digital or otherwise, of lectures, labs, seminars or any other teaching environment by students is allowed only with the prior written consent of the instructor or as a part of an approved accommodation plan. Student or instructor content, digital or otherwise, created and/or used within the context of the course is to be used solely for personal study, and is not to be used or distributed for any other purpose without prior written consent from the content authors.
