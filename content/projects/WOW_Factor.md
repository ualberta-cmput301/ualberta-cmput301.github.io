# WOW Factor

As a bonus 2% to your overall course grade, project teams are able to complete a “wow factor” that differentiates their project from other teams. 
This is an optional component and you can still receive 100% in the course even if you do not complete this. 
Some sample ideas of additions to the project are provided below. 
If you have a different idea than one of the suggestions below then you must approve it with your mentor TA first before working on the feature.

    - React to a comment
3. Map of all nearby events that an entrant can join the draw pool for
