# Project Part 1

* **Due date:** Check the [schedule]({filename}/pages/home.md#schedule).

**Learning Objectives**

* Set up and use collaborative tools for team-based project development.
* Collaborate in a team.

**Exercise**

Your team is expected to use GitHub for a git repository and wiki to share, manage, and store your project artifacts.

* See the Project Teams page for the assigned name of your organization, Example: `indigo`.
* Add CMPUT301F24 to it. Example `CMPUT301F24indigo`
* Come up with a class project name, something interesting but respectful and professional, related to your team name. For example: `indigo-events`
* Make a public git repository that is accessible at all times to team members, the TAs, and the instructor via GitHub. Record the repo URL.
* Create a doc/ directory in your repository, create a team.txt file within doc/, and have each of your team members make a distinct, versioned edit to that file. For each member, that edit must be a line with their GitHub username separated by a space.

(Later in the course, project documentation will be done using the GitHub wiki.)

## **Submission Procedure**

One team member uses [the Google form]() to submit project part 1.

## **Hints**

This exercise can be completed with your team in the labs that cover git and GitHub.

Emails using the wrong subject line may be missed as submissions.
