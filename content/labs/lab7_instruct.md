# Lab 7 Participation Exercise

**# Implement and test activity:**
ShowActivity (create by yourself to have the following property)

    - By clicking on the city list, the UI should change to another activity which is "ShowActivity"

    - The activity shows the city name you have clicked on

    - Create a back button which goes back to MainActivity

**# Test: (create 3 test cases/functions to test the 3 following functionalities)**

    - Check whether the activity correctly switched

    - Test whether the city name is consistent

    - Test the "back" button

Submit the whole Project folder (not just source files or the 'app' directory)
