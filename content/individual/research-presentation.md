# Overview

**This assignment is for graduate students (CMPUT 501) only. CMPUT 402 students do not complete this assignment.**

The goal of this assignment is to read, understand, and present recent research related to the QA topics we've covered in class.

# Requirements

1. Choose a recent full length conference paper or journal article about any of the topics we've covered in class.
    * Must be from the last two years.
    * Must focus on one of the QA topics we've covered in class.
2. Send your choice of paper to the instructor **by March 15th.**
    * The instructor will approve or deny it based on its relevance to the course content, and the above requirements.
3. Read and understand the paper.
    * If you've never done this kind of thing before, you may also need to take a look at least at the abstracts of the important works it cites, so that you have a full understanding of the context.
4. Present the paper to the class. 
    a. Your presentation must be targeted to the audience, which is the undergrads who are in the class.
    b. Presentation should be at between 25-30 minutes, no more, no less.
    c. Presentation should cover all the aspects of the paper: background, research questions/hypothesis, experimental design, results, conclusions the authors drew about it.
    d. If you use diagrams or statements from the paper or other papers they must be cited.
    e. You can use PowerPoint or Google Slides or whatever presentation software you like.
    f. You will need to present in class.
5. You must be able to answer questions about the paper for 5-10 minutes afterwards.
    d. Even if the undergrads decide to skip class or not ask any questions, rest assured that I will be asking you questions.
    e. You are expected to attend each other's presentations and ask questions.
